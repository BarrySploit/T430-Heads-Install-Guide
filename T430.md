Go to the [maintenance manual](http://thinkpads.com/support/hmm/hmm_pdf/t430_t430i_hmm_en_0b48304_03.pdf) and disassemble everything up to the Magnesium structure frame. So:

- “1020 ExpressCard blank bezel” on page 69
    
- “1030 Serial Ultrabay Enhanced bay or blank bezel” on page 70

- “1080 PCI Express Mini Card for wireless WAN or mSATA solid-state drive” on page 75
    
- “1090 Keyboard” on page 80
    Remove screws on back, then pry/slide it up![Keyboard](/docs/assets/Keyboard.jpg)

Once your motherboard is separated, you are ready to move on.

Download heads via github. Download theheads-t430-hotp-maximized-v0.2.0-1798-g97bb0a8-top.rom and heads-t430-hotp-maximized-v0.2.0-1798-g97bb0a8-bottom.rom (Note: These will change slightly depending on version number, but make sure you have the top.rom and bottom.rom)

Ensure to compare the hashes from the circleci release output to the file generated when using either 
Linux Command: sha256sum *filename* or Powershell: get-filehash *filename*
Make sure to compare the hashes for both the top.rom and bottom.rom files and ensure they match. Otherwise, they are corrupted/tampered.

We are going to use an external programmer to flash both the top and bottom chips. Here's a picture of how my programmer looked.

![Programmer P2.jpg](/docs/assets/Programmer\ P2.jpg)
Once that's assembled, you will need to connect it to the proper chips on your mobo. 
To find them, take a look at this image. You will need to peel back a bit of the black tape covering the chips to access them.
![[ChipLocation 1.jpg]]
Those are both of the chips we will be flashing.
One chip is 4MB and the other is 8MB. The files you downloaded should be the same sizes.
When you connect the programmer to each of the chips, it is important to connect the pin 1 of the programmer (it was a red wire in my clip) to pin 1 of the chip you are trying to access.
You can see each pin is numbered on the mobo, but here is an image for reference anyways. The orientation in this image is the same as the prior image. 
![[Pin Location.jpg]]

Once your programmer is connected, it is time to start interacting with the chip!
We are going to have to flash each chip one at a time. So you will do this twice.
Install this program GUI program to interact with the chip on your mobo.
Download it as a ZIP archive and extract. Add a folder called Languages and put the English.ini file in it.
https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/CH341

Move the rom files into the same folder as the CH341.
Launch CH341A.exe (You may need to run the drivers--24CXX25XX.exe to install the driver if they are not already installed.)
Click Chip Search in the top left and type in MX25L3205D (This is the most common chip for T430 thinkpads)
![[Pasted image 20230917150647.png]]
Click Detect and the information at the bottom left should populate. If not, check your connection to the chip. Look at the Size: in this image it is 4MByte so we know that we need to load the top.rom file (because it is also 4MB). 
Note: The top.rom file should be 4MB and the bottom.rom should be 8MB. Be sure to check each chip for its size via the CH341A programmer utility before uploading.

Then click read at the top to verify that you can read the information to ensure you have a good connection. It should have some FF's and other information on it. If you aren't getting any info, try reseating your programmer (metal pins on the clip should be touching the metal pins on the chip).
The top.rom file should be 4MB and the bottom.rom should be 8MB. Be sure to check each chip for its size via the CH341A programmer utility before uploading.

Once you verify that the program is reading the chip. Click Erase and wait for it to clear the chip to all 0's. 
Then click open, select the appropriate .rom file for the chip you are connected to and click Program. 
Once that is complete, scroll through the hexeditor in the program and ensure that it has actual information and not just 0's. 
(Note: If you are unable to see data or get an error, you will need to verify your connection to the chip, erase the content and load it again.)

Repeat this for the other chip and you'll be good to go! You have successfully flashed the BIOS and gotten rid of IntelME. Go ahead and reassemble your device and start configuring heads.
